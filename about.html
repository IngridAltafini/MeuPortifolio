        <h1 class="sobre">About me:</h1>
        <p class="chamo">My name is Ingrid, I'm 17 years old and I joined the IT field this year (2022).</p>
        <p class="consegui">I got this opportunity through the Vem Ser Dev project, when the people involved gave presentations at schools in my city, saying it was a course on IT and English that was totally free, that there were many vacancies for this profession, that it was a unique 
          opportunity and that we not could let it go. Me and more people from my school signed up and in about a week I knew I would be participating in the project.</p>
        <p class="desde">Since then I've been putting in a lot of effort in the classes and I hope to do well from now on, accomplishing my goals and learning a lot more!</p>
